# NeuralNet
This is my project where I plan to create a neural network from scratch in c++. I have decided to undertake this for multiple reasons;
1. I am very interested in machine learning specifically deep learning.
2. I think that to understand deep learning it is very important to be able to build and understand it from the ground up.
3. I wanted to use this opportunity to improve on my modern c++ coding.
4. I wanted to gain a better understnading of lower level object oriented code.

# ToDo

1. Develop script to generate training data to test with.
2. Clean up code.
