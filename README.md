# NeuralNet
This is my project where I plan to create a neural network from scratch in c++. I have decided to undertake this for multiple reasons;
1. I am very interested in machine learning specifically deep learning.
2. I think that to understand deep learning it is very important to be able to build and understand it from the ground up.
3. I wanted to use this opportunity to improve on my modern c++ coding.
4. I wanted to gain a better understnading of lower level object oriented code.

# Steps I'm taking to develop this 

1. Determine a model architecture i.e the number of layers in the model and how many nodes will be in each layer. 
2. Utilise Xavier initialisation to initialise weights and biases of each of the nodes in each layer.
3.
